RailYard Simulation

This program is supposed to simulate a railyard. It is played along the command line. As you play
the rail yard is printed on the command line, such that a '-' represents an empty sopt in the railyard,
a T represents a locomotive, and a lowercase letter represents different destinations. It uses a linked
list to represent each rai, in the yard. Features multiple levels of error checking for an accurate
input.

An example of the input file that is expected is shown in test. It contains multiple rows and can contain
different lengthed columns. The destinations are represented by lowercase letters such as 'a' and the
locomotives are represented by a capital 'T'.
